 *  way so the tables engine can reference "type casting" functions.  The idea
 *  is when coming from SQL to JS to apply the transforms from the "toSql"
 *  object.  The the desired conversion is not found on the "toSql" module the
 *  "toGeneral" module will be checked.
 *
 *  Likewise coming from SQL->JS the same process will be applied, but the
 *  "toGeneral" filter will _not_ be used
